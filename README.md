I turned this repo in but was not satisfied with the work I had done on it so I wanted to restart the assigment but had to turn this in so it would not appear late in my bootcamp spot. I'll attach the new github repo and deployed app below for this assignment I ended up using. Thank you for your hard work and I'm sorry for the inconvenience this may have caused.

new github repo: https://github.com/kyle-mucerino/tech-blog.git
